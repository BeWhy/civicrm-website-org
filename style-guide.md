This style guide is written for anyone creating content for the CiviCRM website and its related websites (documentation, conference sites, etc.).

CiviCRM websites are built using bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/) so we can do less wheel re-inventing and focus on content, hence all of bootstrap's css, components, and JS is potentially available for use.

These guidelines outline the bits of bootstrap that we prefer to use in most situations. They should be useful as a cheat sheet for anyone that is creating pages on CiviCRM's website.

# Making stuff stand out

* The .lead class can be used to make text stand out (http://getbootstrap.com/css/#lead-body-copy)
* The blockquote tag should be used for any quotes from people (http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type-blockquotes)
* Bootstrap's button classes (http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons) are available for inviting clicks
* http://getbootstrap.com/css/#small-text can be used for fine print.

Headings should only be used for headings and not not make text stand out.
